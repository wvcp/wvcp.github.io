<p>The educations of the <strong>Westboro Village Cooperative Preschool</strong>&#39;s students get a big extra boost from the additional daily help of a co-op member, performing their <a href="cooperate.html">duty day</a>, but their <strong><em>complete educational needs</em></strong> will be met by our outstanding, qualified and caring staff.</p>

<p>In our classroom, your preschooler will learn through play, and be helped along on these first steps onto the paths of education by the following capable hands:&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lawrence is a former WVCP parent working towards completing the Early Childhood Education diploma at Algonquin College, and has been part of WVCP for many years. His children attended the school, he worked as a substitute teacher and most recently a junior teacher. He holds a Master's Degree in Political Philosophy, including a major research paper on Rousseau's <i>Emile</i>, a work that focuses on the education of a young child. In addition to this research interest in education, he has long enjoyed spending time with young children. He's also bilingual and happy to expose children to new language and learning experiences.</p>
