<p>The educations of the <strong>Westboro Village Cooperative Preschool</strong>&#39;s students get a big extra boost from the additional daily help of two co-op members, performing their <a href="cooperate.html">duty day</a>, but their <strong><em>complete educational needs</em></strong> will be met by our outstanding, qualified and caring staff.</p>

<p>In our classroom, your preschooler will learn through play, and be helped along on these first steps onto the paths of education by the following capable hands:&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<h3 style="margin-left: 120px;"><img src="images/teachers/Meenu.jpg" style="margin-right: 10px; float: left; width: 185px; height: 240px;" /><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color:#008000;">Meenu Aeri, WVCP ECE Director</span></span></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Meenu graduated in 2007 with an Early Childhood Education (ECE) diploma from Algonquin College. Since then, she has gained a variety of experience in the field. Most recently, she worked at Algonquin College as a field placement supervisor, supervising and advising ECE students while on their placements. We are thrilled she has accepted our offer to begin a new chapter at our preschool.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">An accomplished artist, Meenu has extensive experience and will apply this artistic ability and knowledge to daily developmental activities such as arts and craft projects. She believes in bringing the outdoors in, thereby promoting an appreciation of nature and the environment in the kids.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lawrence is a former WVCP parent working towards completing the Early Childhood Education diploma at Algonquin College, and has been part of WVCP for many years. His children attended the school, he worked as a substitute teacher and most recently a junior teacher. He holds a Master's Degree in Political Philosophy, including a major research paper on Rousseau's <i>Emile</i>, a work that focuses on the education of a young child. In addition to this research interest in education, he has long enjoyed spending time with young children. He's also bilingual and happy to expose children to new language and learning experiences.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Megan is a graduate of the intensive Early Childhood Education program at Algonquin College and has an Honours Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto, where she majored in English literature. She loves to read and write short stories and poetry. She also loves music, and is pretty sure she knows the words to almost every Disney song.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Megan is delighted to be joining the team at the Westboro Village Cooperative Preschool! These are some of her favourite age groups to work with, and she hopes to work with them for a long time to come. Megan is looking forward to getting to know each family, and working with parents to ensure that their child is healthy, happy, and learning something new every day.</p>
